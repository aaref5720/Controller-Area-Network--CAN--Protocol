# CAN-CASE-Study-1: STM32 CAN_MODE_LOOPBACK (Simulated in Keil MicroVision)

This project demonstrates a simple CAN communication setup in **CAN_MODE_LOOPBACK** using an STM32 microcontroller, simulated in **Keil MicroVision**. The system sends and receives the same data over the CAN bus to verify correct transmission and reception.

## Purpose
The CAN loopback mode is useful for verifying that CAN communication is functioning correctly without needing a second device or node on the CAN bus.
