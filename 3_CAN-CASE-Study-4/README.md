# CAN-CASE-Study-4: CANoe Simulation with GUI and Database

This case study is similar to **CAN-CASE-Study-2** but implemented using **CANoe simulation**, with additional features such as a graphical user interface (GUI) and a database for logging.

## Components
- A **switch** in the GUI controls the acceleration indicator.
- An **analog indicator** in the GUI represents the vehicle speed.

## Purpose
This simulation demonstrates the use of CANoe for visualizing and testing CAN communication in a more user-friendly and flexible environment, allowing for easier manipulation of input (acceleration) and observation of output (speed).
